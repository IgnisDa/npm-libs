## Why use this pagination module?

- **Accessible.** Semantic HTML and fully marked up with appropriate aria roles for
  assisted browsing.
- **Usable.** The base CSS styles account for keyboard focus states and fat finger touch targets.
- **Responsive.** Works on all devices.
- **Theme-able.** Make it look however you want via custom classes.
- **Self contained.** There's only two required prop to get going. The rest of the logic is
  handled for you.
- **Works with Remix.** Integrated with the Remix router.

## Installing

```bash
pnpm install @ignisda/remix-pagination
# or the corresponding install command of your favorite package manager
```

## Usage

This component is fairly self contained. You will need to pass the **total number of
potential results** and the **number of results in each page** in order to calculate the
number of pages to show.

```jsx
import { RemixPagination } from '@ignisda/remix-pagination';

export default function () {
  return (
    <div>
      <RemixPagination total={100} size={20} />;
    </div>
  );
}
```

You will need to import the CSS like you would in any Remix app as explained
[here](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/styling).

```tsx
import { styles } from '@ignisda/remix-pagination';

export const links: LinksFunction = () => [{ rel: 'stylesheet', href: styles }];
```

When used, the pagination component will reload the same route with added pagination query
params.

- `page` for the page number the user is on.

The **default page** is 1.

## Theming

All components have the class `remix-pagination__$component` applied to them. This can be
changed via the `classPrefix` prop. You can see an example
[here](https://github.com/IgnisDa/npm-libs/blob/39e95b2b74331b2e90e6edf419ec91c0e302f379/apps/remix-pagination-demo/app/routes/index.tsx#L29).

## Contributing

This package was created with [NX](nx). You will need it installed to run this
project.

### Setup

To get set up you'll need to run `pnpm install`

### Development

In the root folder, run `npx nx serve remix-pagination-demo`. Then head over to
`http://localhost:3000` to see the example running.

Note: You will have to restart the dev server every time you make any changes to
`packages/remix-pagination` because Remix does not watch for files outside it's project. I
have not yet figured out how to fix this.

### Publishing
